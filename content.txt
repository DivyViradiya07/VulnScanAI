DESCRIPTION

NX

False

info

The binary does not have NX bit set. NX bit offer protection against exploitation of memory corruption

vulnerabilities by marking memory page as non-executable. However iOS never allows an app to execute from

writeable memory. You do not need to specifically enable the ‘NX bit’ because it’s always enabled for all third-

party code.

PIE

True

info

The binary is build with -fPIC flag which enables Position independent code. This makes Return Oriented

Programming (ROP) attacks much more difficult to execute reliably.

STACK CANARY

True

info

This binary has a stack canary value added to the stack so that it will be overwritten by a stack buffer that

overflows the return address. This allows detection of overflows by verifying the integrity of the canary before

function return.

ARC

False

warning

This binary has debug symbols stripped. We cannot identify whether ARC is enabled or not. 

RPATH

False

info

The binary does not have Runpath Search Path (@rpath) set.

App can be installed on a vulnerable

upatched Android version

Android 1.6, [minSdk=4]

high

This application can be installed on an older version of android that has multiple unfixed

vulnerabilities. These devices won't receive reasonable security updates from Google.

Support an Android version => 10, API 29 to receive reasonable security updates.

Debug Enabled For App

[android:debuggable=true]

high

Debugging was enabled on the app which makes it easier for reverse engineers to hook a

debugger to it. This allows dumping a stack trace and accessing debugging helper classes.

Application Data can be Backed up

[android:allowBackup] flag is missing.

warning

The flag [android:allowBackup] should be set to false. By default it is set to true and allows     

anyone to backup your application data via adb. It allows users who have enabled USB

debugging to copy application data off of the device.

Android 4.0-4.0.2,

[minSdk=14]

high

This application can be installed on an older version of android that has multiple unfixed vulnerabilities.

Backed up

[android:allowBackup=true]

warning

This flag allows anyone to backup your application data via adb. It allows users who have enabled USB
