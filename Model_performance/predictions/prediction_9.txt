the report suggests the following stepwise remediation:

1. verify design assumptions: regularly review and verify design assumptions to prevent insecure design flaws. this includes validating that security requirements are properly addressed and that the intended security posture is being maintained.  
2. test security controls: comprehensively test security controls to ensure they function as intended. this involves validating that the controls are properly implemented, configured, and maintained, and that they provide the expected level of protection.  
3. document design decisions and security controls: keep detailed documentation of design decisions and security controls. this helps track the design process and ensures that security controls are properly implemented and maintained over time. documentation also facilitates communication between teams and ensures that everyone involved in the system's development, maintenance, and security understands the design decisions and security controls.  
4. mitigate injection vulnerabilities: since injection vulnerabilities are diverse and complex, a layered mitigation strategy is recommended. this includes input validation, parameterized queries, output encoding, and user-input filtering. implementing these measures helps prevent injection attacks and protects against various types of injection vulnerabilities.  
5. address cryptographic failures: implement secure cryptographic practices to mitigate the risk of cryptographic failures. this includes using strong algorithms, properly configuring key sizes and key management, and ensuring that encryption and decryption are done correctly.  
6. strengthen security headers: implement strong security headers to prevent common web application vulnerabilities such as xss and clickjacking. this includes setting appropriate content-security-policy, x-frame-options, and x-xss-protection headers, as well as using https to protect against eavesdropping and tampering.  
7. hide software version information: remove or obfuscate software version information from publicly accessible sources to reduce the risk of targeted exploits. this can be achieved by configuring web servers and application code to hide version information, or by using techniques such as version number randomization.
