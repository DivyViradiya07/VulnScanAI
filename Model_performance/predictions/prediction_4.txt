remediation steps from the sslscan report:

1. disable tls fallback scsv: the sslscan report indicates that the server supports tls fallback scsv, which can potentially allow downgrade attacks. to mitigate this issue, disable tls fallback scsv to prevent downgrade attacks. this can be done by configuring the server to disable tls fallback scsv and ensuring that all clients are using a secure protocol version.

2. review and remove weak ciphers: the sslscan report shows that the server supports multiple ciphers, including some weak ciphers. weak ciphers can potentially be exploited by attackers if they can find a way to exploit them. to strengthen security, review and remove any weak ciphers from the server configuration. this can be done by configuring the server to only support strong ciphers that provide adequate security.

3. enable tlsv1.3: the sslscan report indicates that tlsv1.3 is currently disabled. tlsv1.3 is the latest version of the protocol and provides better security features and stronger encryption than tlsv1.2. to improve security, enable tlsv1.3 on the server and ensure that clients can communicate using this protocol version.

4. regularly update ssl/tls configuration: to stay up-to-date with security patches and updates, regularly review and update the ssl/tls configuration of the server. this can include updating the ssl/tls protocols, ciphers, and key exchange algorithms to ensure that the server is using the latest and most secure configurations.

5. ensure proper ssl certificate management: the sslscan report indicates that the ssl certificate is valid and has a key strength of 4096 bits, indicating that the server has proper authentication and encryption in place. to maintain the security of the ssl certificate, ensure that it is properly configured and managed. this can include regularly monitoring the certificate's expiration date, revoking and replacing the certificate if it is compromised, and using strong passphrases and secure key storage practices.

6. ensure compliance with regulatory requirements: the sslscan report can be used to identify any compliance issues related to the ssl/tls configuration of the server. to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, review the specific ssl/tls configurations that are required by the relevant regulatory bodies and ensure that the server meets these requirements. this can include configuring the server to support specific ssl/tls protocols, ciphers, and key exchange algorithms, and regularly reviewing and updating the configuration to meet any changing compliance requirements.
