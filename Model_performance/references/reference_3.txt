implications of the sslscan report:

1. potential downgrade attacks: tls fallback scsv support may expose the server to downgrade attacks if attackers trick clients into connecting with outdated protocol versions. this weakens communication security by enabling insecure protocols.

2. lack of tlsv1.3 support: the absence of tlsv1.3, which offers enhanced encryption and modern security features, reduces overall protocol security. using only tlsv1.2 may leave the server open to older attacks that tlsv1.3 helps prevent.

3. weak cipher support: the server allows multiple ciphers, including weak ones. these weak ciphers can be exploited if not removed, leading to weakened encryption and increased risk of data compromise.

4. ssl certificate security: although the certificate is valid and uses a 4096-bit key, misconfiguration or compromise could still result in data integrity issues or identity theft. proper certificate management is essential for secure authentication.

5. compliance issues: the sslscan report helps identify whether the server's ssl/tls configuration meets industry standards and regulatory requirements. non-compliance could lead to security gaps, penalties, or loss of certification.
