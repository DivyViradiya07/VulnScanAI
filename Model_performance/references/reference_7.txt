the report identifies several key issues:

1. continuous verification of design assumptions is essential to reduce the likelihood of insecure design flaws  
2. thorough testing of security controls ensures they operate as expected and provide effective protection  
3. proper documentation supports traceability of design decisions and helps maintain security controls over time  
4. injection vulnerabilities span across 33 cwes, requiring layered defense mechanisms for effective mitigation  
5. cryptographic failures are highly exploitable, with a calculated average exploitability score of 7.29

the application received a security rating of 32 out of 100. this score reflects the cumulative impact and severity of the discovered vulnerabilities. the low score highlights the significant risk level and emphasizes the need for immediate remediation efforts
