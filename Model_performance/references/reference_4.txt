remediation steps from the sslscan report:

1. disable tls fallback scsv: since tls fallback scsv may allow downgrade attacks, it is recommended to disable it in the server configuration. this helps ensure that clients use only secure versions of the protocol.

2. review and remove weak ciphers: weak ciphers present in the server's configuration can be exploited by attackers. to enhance security, the server should be updated to allow only strong, modern ciphers.

3. enable tlsv1.3: the sslscan report shows that tlsv1.3 is disabled. enabling tlsv1.3 improves encryption strength and supports modern security practices. ensure clients can connect using this version.

4. update ssl/tls configuration regularly: security standards evolve, so it's important to keep the ssl/tls settings current. this includes using updated protocols, secure ciphers, and reliable key exchange methods.

5. manage ssl certificate properly: although the ssl certificate has strong encryption, its management must be secure. regularly check expiration, replace compromised certificates, and store private keys securely.

6. meet compliance requirements: check if the current ssl/tls setup adheres to regulatory standards. adjust configurations to match any requirements on protocols, ciphers, or key sizes, and keep them updated.
