the report recommends the following remediation steps:

1. regularly validate design assumptions to ensure the architecture aligns with security goals and remains free from logical flaws.  
2. perform extensive testing on all security mechanisms to confirm they operate correctly and offer adequate protection.  
3. maintain up-to-date documentation of design and control decisions to improve visibility, aid future audits, and support consistent implementation across development and operations.  
4. apply layered defenses against injection attacks by using input validation, parameterized queries, encoding outputs, and sanitizing user inputs.  
5. resolve cryptographic issues by adopting industry-standard encryption algorithms, managing keys securely, and avoiding deprecated or misconfigured settings.  
6. configure strict security headers to block xss, clickjacking, and protocol downgrade attacks. use content-security-policy, x-frame-options, x-xss-protection, and enforce https connections.  
7. minimize exposure of software version details to prevent attackers from leveraging known exploits against identified technologies. obfuscate or disable version disclosures where feasible.
