the zap scan report for https://saucedemo.com identified 9 alerts, including 3 medium-risk and 2 low-risk issues. no high-risk or informational alerts were detected, and no false positives were found.

key findings:

1. content security policy (csp) header is not set  
the website does not implement a csp header, which could help prevent cross-site scripting (xss) and injection attacks by restricting resource loading policies

2. cross-domain misconfiguration  
the server has a cors configuration that may allow unauthorized cross-origin data access, potentially exposing sensitive information to untrusted domains

3. missing anti-clickjacking header  
the response lacks headers to defend against clickjacking. neither x-frame-options nor a csp with frame-ancestors directive is set

remediation steps:

1. implement a proper content-security-policy header to restrict resources and mitigate xss and injection risks  
2. review and secure the cors configuration to limit resource access to trusted domains only  
3. add either the x-frame-options header or content-security-policy with frame-ancestors directive to protect against clickjacking attacks
