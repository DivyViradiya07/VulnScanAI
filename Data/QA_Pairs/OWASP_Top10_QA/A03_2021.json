      "question": "Why should developers avoid constructing dynamic SQL queries by concatenating user inputs, and what alternatives exist?",
      "answer": "Dynamic SQL queries built by directly concatenating user input are extremely vulnerable to injection because malicious users can manipulate the input to alter query structure or execute arbitrary commands. For instance, appending `'; DROP TABLE users; --` to a query can cause catastrophic data loss. To avoid this, developers should use prepared statements with parameterized queries or stored procedures where input is passed as parameters, never concatenated. These alternatives safely handle input by separating code from data, preventing malicious input from being interpreted as executable SQL.",

      "answer": "Escaping adds special characters (like backslashes or HTML entities) before control characters (quotes, semicolons) in user inputs to prevent them from being interpreted as part of the code or command syntax. Encoding transforms characters into a safe representation before processing, which is crucial in contexts like HTML or URL parameters. These methods help prevent injection by neutralizing special characters that could otherwise break syntax and enable malicious execution. However, escaping is context-sensitive — improper or incomplete escaping can still lead to vulnerabilities. Therefore, escaping should complement, not replace, parameterized queries or strict validation.",

Most ORMs automatically generate parameterized queries, handling input safely without developers manually constructing raw SQL. This reduces the risk of injection by minimizing direct query manipulation. Additionally, ORMs offer methods to safely build queries with filtering and sorting while escaping inputs properly. However, developers must still be cautious when using ORM features that allow raw queries or concatenation to avoid accidental injection risks.",
