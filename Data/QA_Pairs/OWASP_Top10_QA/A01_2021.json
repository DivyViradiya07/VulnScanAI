      "question": "How does minimizing attack surfaces by disabling unnecessary features or APIs proactively reduce Broken Access Control risks?",
      "answer": "Removing or disabling unused functionalities limits opportunities for attackers to exploit overlooked access controls or misconfigurations. Smaller attack surfaces are easier to secure and audit thoroughly.",

      "question": "How can regular security audits and penetration testing serve as proactive measures against Broken Access Control?",
      "answer": "Audits and penetration tests simulate attacker techniques to identify access control weaknesses that may have been missed. They provide actionable insights to strengthen controls and verify compliance with security standards.",

      "question": "Why is it important to segregate duties and enforce role separation to proactively prevent Broken Access Control?",
      "answer": "Role separation ensures that no single user has excessive permissions that could be abused. Segregating duties limits the impact of compromised accounts or insider threats by restricting access to sensitive functions.",

      "question": "How does using strong cryptographic techniques to protect access tokens and session data help proactively prevent Broken Access Control?",
      "answer": "Strong encryption and secure storage prevent attackers from intercepting or tampering with tokens and sessions. This preserves their integrity and confidentiality, ensuring that only authorized users can gain access.",
