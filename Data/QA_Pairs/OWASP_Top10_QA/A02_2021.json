      "answer": "Cryptographic Failures refer to situations where sensitive data is not adequately protected due to the absence, misuse, or weak implementation of cryptographic mechanisms. These failures often stem from using outdated encryption algorithms, poor key management, or simply transmitting or storing data without encryption. It is considered a serious vulnerability because it can lead to data breaches, loss of user trust, regulatory violations (such as GDPR or HIPAA), and potentially severe financial penalties. Sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, personal identifiers, and session tokens must be safeguarded using modern cryptographic practices to prevent unauthorized access or leakage.",

      "answer": "Proper cryptographic implementation ensures that data remains confidential and tamper-proof, whether it's being transmitted over the network (data in transit) or stored in databases or files (data at rest). Without encryption, attackers can intercept data using tools like packet sniffers or retrieve it from compromised storage systems. Even if encryption is used, incorrect implementation—such as using weak algorithms (like MD5 or SHA1), hard-coded keys, or failing to validate certificates—can render it ineffective. Therefore, applying strong, vetted encryption algorithms along with secure protocols (like TLS 1.2 or 1.3) is essential to protect sensitive information.",
